# CLArduino

server.js is for serial connection and contains web interface
express.js was a test of a 3rd party library to connect to arduino that was not super useful
hapi.js is poorly named and doesn't use hapi at all but contains TCP connection information

Latest code I was working on was in the workingWifi folder
arduinoColors should work with server.js (assuming I haven't broken anything in a while) 
The other two were more for tests and I didn't use them much
